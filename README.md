<h1>HIPPO CHAT</h1>

People, involved in the project:
1. https://github.com/ginkogrudev | https://softuni.bg/users/profile/show/GinkoGrudev
2. https://github.com/VaskoViktorov | https://softuni.bg/users/profile/show/Backo_vd
3. https://github.com/Bullsized | https://softuni.bg/users/profile/show/Bullsized > Created the repository, so we can all participate, invited Ginko and Vasko as collaborators. Created the main UI of the chat, showed how registered users can customize their profile and/or other personal details; create, join and participate in both public and private chat rooms, view other people's profiles, attach files, send pictures and so on - everything is in the Bullsized\ folder.

And unfortunately we do NOT have a number 4, because of the js-teamwork.github.io system having a bug and putting him in two groups, so it's just the three of us.

Online Live Chat
1.	Requirements
Create a Web-based application for real-time text messaging. Users can connect anonymously with a nickname and participate in different chat rooms.
Provide the following functionality to all visitors (without authentication):
•	Send messages anonymously under a nickname
•	Join public chat rooms
In addition to the previous functionality, registered users can:
•	Customize their profile with a picture and other personal details
•	Reserve a nickname
•	Create and join private chat rooms (with password protection)
Authenticated administrators have additional options, available in the normal views of the app. They should have the ability to:
•	View the profiles of all users
•	Mute or ban users who post inappropriate messages
•	Join all chat rooms, including password protected ones
Create a Web UI prototype for the Online Chat system.

2.	Team Organization
Create a GitHub organization for all team members, or a GitHub project with collaborators. Initialize the project with a Readme.md file in which you should describe what each team member is doing.
Split the different views (core pages) of your assignment and have each team member work on at least one task. Commit the results to the GitHub repository.

3.	Tools
When creating the prototypes, you are free to use whatever method you like, including paper and post-it notes (take pictures and commit them to the repository). Additionally, you may use image editing software, HTML+CSS, or a prototyping tool (Indigo Studio, Balsamiq, etc.).

4.	Submitting Your Work
If you used a prototyping tool that works online, submit a link to your project page instead, and make sure it’s publicly accessible. Every team member submits the same link!
